# clothes_bot
Telegram bot for viewing the catalog of various categories of clothing and goods of these categories (the ability to display prices and buy and sell is also realizable).

To work you need:
1) a database that will store product categories, products themselves and links for feedback (optional). The base structure will be given below;
2) the token of the bot created through BotFather (https://t.me/BotFather).
